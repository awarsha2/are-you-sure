# are-you-sure
Browser extension that asks if you're sure if you enter something weird.

## Mission
On 06/06/2023 I posted something bad and dumb for no decent reason and got banned from a twitch chat. This should stop me from doing that.

##To-Do:
- check text box
- warning/interrupt
- base look up/check
- user customizable/local look up/check
